// with git we've saved our code with different versions locally and on the cloud and we've copied code that others have wrote
// git collaboration, how do we work on a project together?

// How can I see if I already have git going in a project folder?
// git status

// git add . ; git commit -m "message"

// git log --oneline

// create new repo on GitHub
// local git has no idea where our new repo on GitHub is
// git remote to make the link
